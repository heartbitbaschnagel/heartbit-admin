        Upon completion of their 2021-2022 Senior Project, the HeartBit team 
        wrote some guides to help walk you through some possible sticking 
        points we anticipated.
      </p>
      <p>
        These guides, along with all of our other deliverables, should be 
        easily viewable in a Google Drive folder owned by the google account 
        we set up for you, heartbitbaschnagel@gmail.com.

          This is a link to that folder.

        Feel free to share permission to access that folder with whoever you 
        trust by managing its share access directly in Google. Best of luck!
